  <p>Welcome to GlassApp. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the GlassApp desktop software (the "App") and the GlassApp website and licensing services (collectively, the "Service"). By downloading, installing, or using the App or the Service, you agree to these Terms.</p>

  <h2>1. License</h2>
  <p>We grant you a personal, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to install and use the App on devices you own or control. The free tier is limited as described on our site. A paid license ("Pro") unlocks additional features and higher limits.</p>

  <h2>2. Accounts and Keys</h2>
  <p>Pro access is activated with a license key. You are responsible for keeping your key confidential. We may revoke or reissue a key in cases of suspected abuse, fraud, or violation of these Terms.</p>

  <h2>3. Acceptable Use</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Do not reverse engineer, modify, or redistribute the App except as permitted by law.</li>
    <li>Do not use the Service to violate applicable laws or infringe the rights of others.</li>
    <li>Do not attempt to circumvent usage limits, licensing, or security mechanisms.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Software Updates</h2>
  <p>We may deliver updates that improve functionality, fix bugs, or change features. Some updates may be required to continue using the Service.</p>

  <h2>5. Payments and Refunds</h2>
  <p>Payments are processed by our payment partner (e.g., Gumroad). Their terms and policies apply to transactions. Unless stated otherwise by the payment partner, purchases are non-refundable.</p>

  <h2>6. Privacy</h2>
  <p>Your use of the Service is also governed by our <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>. We only collect the minimal data needed to validate licenses and provide the Service.</p>

  <h2>7. Disclaimers</h2>
  <p>The Service is provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" without warranties of any kind. We do not warrant that the App will be error-free or uninterrupted.</p>

  <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or exemplary damages, or for loss of revenue, profits, data, or use, arising out of or related to your use of the Service.</p>

  <h2>9. Termination</h2>
  <p>We may suspend or terminate access to the Service (including revoking license tokens) if you breach these Terms or misuse the Service.</p>

  <h2>10. Changes to These Terms</h2>
  <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. If changes are material, we will take reasonable steps to notify you (for example, via the site). Continued use after changes take effect constitutes acceptance.</p>

  <h2>11. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about these Terms, email us at <a href="mailto:support@glassapp.me">support@glassapp.me</a>.</p>
